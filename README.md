## BombeChain

#### The Headless Streaming Service
BombeChain is a from-scratch javascript blockchain that will provide nodes for streaming. Users will be able to harvest bombe from acting as a peer for allowing other peers to get the best stream experience.

##### What is the consensus mechanism?
We are currently working on finding the best consensus mechanism for the project.

##### Roadmap
We do not have a roadmap as this is not a deadline project and is currently being made for fun
